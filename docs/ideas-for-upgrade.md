# Ideas for Upgrade (Low Priority, Post-Launch)

- Authors invite co-authors to collaborate on stories.
- Story collections & series: Group multiple stories into a "series" with metadata (title, description, reading order) and separate pages/URLs.
- Readers create custom collections/lists of stories.
- Reading statistics (time spent reading, reading streaks).
- Stories translatable (multiple language versions).
- Mods issue warnings to authors before deletion (via email/private note?).
- Content recommendations based on reading history/ratings (machine learning).
- Reader social features: Follow other readers, see what friends are reading, create reading lists.
- Gamification: Badges, achievements, or leaderboards for active readers/authors.
- Donation/Monetization: Authors accept donations or set stories as "premium" (paid access).
- User forums or discussion boards.
- Writing prompts/challenges.
- Author awards or voting systems.
- Live chat or real-time notifications.
- Audiobook/text-to-speech integration.
- Bookmark specific passages (not just stories).
- Note-taking functionality for readers.
