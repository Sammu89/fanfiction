On the story listing of admin panel, we need to have granular and bulk control.


When admins sets to publish a story that doesn't meet the requirements (no chapters, no description, etc, those already are coded), it will fail silently for the specific story, with a wp admin message saying publish story name failed because it doesn't meet the minimum requirement.
