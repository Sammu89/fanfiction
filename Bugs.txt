- On search bar, when several fandoms are selected, i see them on the url and pills : ex &fanfic_story_fandoms=364%201407, but when i hit search, only the first term is on pills instead all of them when page reloads.

- The url slug is outputing this like ?status=abandoned%20finished&language=pt%20pt-br&fanfic_story_fandoms=364%201407
-- I want the agregator "+" between values, not %20
