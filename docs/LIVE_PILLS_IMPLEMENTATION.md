# Live Filter Pills Implementation

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Real-Time Filter Pills** ✨
When users check/uncheck any filter, a pill instantly appears below the search form showing what filter was selected. No page reload, no button click needed.

**Example:**
```
User checks "Action" genre checkbox
  ↓
JavaScript detects change
  ↓
"Action" pill appears instantly below search form
  ↓
User checks "Adventure" genre checkbox
  ↓
"Adventure" pill appears next to "Action" pill
```

### 2. **Always-Visible Common Filters**
Common filters are now visible by default:
- Genres
- Age Rating
- Languages

Advanced/less-used filters remain behind a "More filters" toggle:
- Fandoms
- Custom Taxonomies
- Warnings (Include/Exclude)
- Match ALL toggle

**New Layout:**
```
────────────────────────────────────
Header: "Browse Stories"
────────────────────────────────────
Basic Search Row
  ├─ Text search input
  ├─ Status dropdown
  ├─ Sort dropdown
  ├─ Clear filters button
  └─ Search button
────────────────────────────────────
🔹 COMMON FILTERS (ALWAYS VISIBLE)
  ├─ Genres (multi-select)
  ├─ Age Rating (dropdown)
  └─ Languages (multi-select)
────────────────────────────────────
[+] More filters (collapsible)
    Advanced Filters (hidden by default)
      ├─ Match ALL toggle
      ├─ Fandoms search
      ├─ Custom Taxonomies
      └─ Warnings (Include/Exclude)
────────────────────────────────────
🎯 ACTIVE FILTER PILLS (LIVE UPDATED!)
  "Action" "Adventure" "13+" "English"
────────────────────────────────────
Search Results
────────────────────────────────────
```

## How It Works

### JavaScript Flow

**1. Initialization (Page Load)**
```javascript
// On document ready:
activePillsManager.updatePills();
// Scans current filters and generates pills
```

**2. Change Detection**
```javascript
// Listen to all form inputs
$(document).on('change', '.fanfic-browse-form input, select', function() {
  activePillsManager.updatePills();
});

// Also listen to text input with debounce
$('#fanfic-search-input').on('keyup', function() {
  // Wait 300ms after user stops typing
  // Then update pills
});
```

**3. Filter Collection**
```javascript
// Get all current filter values from form
var filters = {
  search: "user's search term",
  status: "completed",
  genres: ["Action", "Adventure"],
  age: "13+",
  languages: ["English"],
  // ... etc
};
```

**4. Pill Generation**
```javascript
// Convert filters to readable pills
// "Action" + "Adventure" → displays as pills
// "Age: 13+" → displays as pill
// "English" → displays as pill
```

**5. DOM Update**
```javascript
// Replace pills container with new pills
$activePillsContainer.html(html);
// Smooth animation applied via CSS
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `assets/js/fanfic-search-bar-frontend.js`
**Added:**
- `activePillsManager` object with methods:
  - `getCurrentFilters()` - Collects all form values
  - `generatePills()` - Creates pill HTML
  - `updatePills()` - Updates DOM
- Event listeners for all filter changes
- Debouncing for text input (300ms)

**No breaking changes** - All existing functionality preserved.

### 2. `includes/shortcodes/class-fanfic-shortcodes-search.php`
**Changes:**
- Reorganized filters layout
- Moved Genres, Age Rating, Languages out of "Advanced" toggle
- Renamed "Advanced search" to "More filters"
- Updated localization to include `activeFilters` i18n string
- Removed duplicate languages section

**No breaking changes** - Form still works the same way.

### 3. `assets/css/fanfic-search-bar.css`
**Added:**
- `.fanfic-common-filters` - Styling for always-visible filters
- `.fanfic-live-filter-pills` - Container for pills
- `.fanfic-filter-pill` - Individual pill styling
- Animation effects (slide-in, pill-appear)
- Responsive adjustments for mobile

**No breaking changes** - Old styles still apply.

## Behavior Details

### When Pills Update
Pills update automatically when:
- ✅ Any checkbox is checked/unchecked
- ✅ Any dropdown is changed
- ✅ Any multi-select is changed
- ✅ Text search input changes (after 300ms pause)
- ✅ Any hidden form field changes

### What Shows in Pills
Pills show human-readable versions of selected filters:
- Search text as-is
- Status name (e.g., "Completed" not "completed")
- Genre names (e.g., "Action" not "action")
- Age ratings (e.g., "13+" not "13")
- Language names (e.g., "English" not "en")
- Taxonomy names
- Special cases like warnings with mode (e.g., "Violence (exclude)")

### What Doesn't Show
Filters that are empty/default don't show pills:
- Empty search
- "All Statuses" selected
- "Relevance / Updated" sort
- "Any age" selected
- No genres selected
- Match ALL toggle OFF (optional)

### Performance
- **Debounced** text input (300ms) prevents excessive updates while typing
- **Fast updates** for checkboxes/selects (instant)
- **Lightweight** - Only processes form values, no database queries
- **No AJAX** - Pure client-side JavaScript

- [ ] Select "13+" age → "13+" pill appears
- [ ] Type in search → Pill appears after 300ms
- [ ] Clear search input → Pill disappears

## Browser Compatibility

✅ All modern browsers
- Chrome 60+

- Safari 11+
- Edge 79+
- Mobile browsers

**jQuery version:** Uses ES5 compatible syntax, works with jQuery 1.x+

---

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Click pill to remove filter** - Make pills clickable to remove that filter
2. **Filter suggestions** - Show popular filters as user types
3. **Search history** - Save past filter combinations
4. **Favorite filters** - Let users save filter sets
5. **Mobile swipe to dismiss** - Swipe pills to remove them
6. **Filter count badge** - Show "3 filters active" in header
7. **Advanced mode toggle** - Remember if user likes advanced filters open

---

## Troubleshooting

### Pills Not Appearing
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `data-fanfic-active-filters` div exists in HTML
- Check that `fanficSearchBar.i18n.activeFilters` is localized
- Clear browser cache and reload

### Pills Appear But Don't Update
- Check that form inputs have correct `name` attributes
- Verify JavaScript is loaded (check Network tab in DevTools)
- Check for conflicting JavaScript libraries
- Look for jQuery conflicts

### Pills Update But Look Wrong
- Check CSS is loaded (should have blue background)
- Clear browser cache
- Check browser zoom level
- Test in different browser

### Performance Issues
- Text input debounce is set to 300ms (adjustable in JS)
- Reduce debounce delay if feeling too sluggish
- Check for excessive DOM updates in console

## Technical Notes

### Data Binding
Pills are **not** bound to form via two-way data binding. Instead:
- Pills are **generated from form state** on every change
- Form is the source of truth
- Pills are always accurate reflection of form

### Why No Two-Way Binding
- Simpler implementation
- No external dependencies
- Faster performance
- Less risk of form/pills getting out of sync

### URL Integration
Currently, pills are display-only and **don't affect URL parameters**.

To add URL syncing in future:
```javascript
// After updatePills(), also do:
var newUrl = buildUrlFromFilters(filters);
window.history.pushState({}, '', newUrl);
```

---

## No AJAX Endpoint Removed

As you mentioned, the AJAX endpoint (`fanfic_search` action) was **kept as-is**. It:
- Doesn't interfere with pill functionality
- Has zero performance impact when not used
- Could be useful for future enhancements
- Follows WordPress best practices for extensibility

The pills work entirely on the frontend with no backend calls.

---

## Code Quality

✅ Follows WordPress coding standards
✅ Uses proper escaping in localization
✅ No inline JavaScript
✅ Properly enqueued scripts/styles
✅ Accessible markup with ARIA labels
✅ Responsive design
✅ Graceful degradation (works without JavaScript for form submission)

---

## Summary

**What users see:**
- Filters are easier to find (no hidden toggle for common ones)
- Instant visual feedback when they select filters
- Pills disappear when they deselect
- Clean, organized interface

**What developers benefit from:**
- Pure JavaScript solution (no complex frameworks)
- Easy to extend or modify
- No breaking changes
- Backward compatible with existing form submission
